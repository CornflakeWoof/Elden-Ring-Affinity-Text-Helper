# Elden Ring Affinity Text Helper
Small utility made in Godot Engine to help quickly create text for weaponry and their affinities in Elden Ring.

This utility does expect the relevant MSGBNDs have already been opened with Yabber - when ERATH generates text, the result is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy pasting into a MSGBND's converted XML file.
